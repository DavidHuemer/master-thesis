Generate a JML (Java Modelling Language) for the following JavaDoc:
{javadoc}

The parameters for the method the comment describes are: {parameters}
Only include the JML, nothing else, no code, no comments, no method name, nothing.
Do not include the name of the programming language.
Every line should start with the Java Comment symbol "//"
Do not use any external classes or methods.
Do not use any other classes, no static ones, nothing.
That means classes like Math, Arrays, etc. are not allowed.
Do not include any code that must be imported
So for example, Math.abs is not allowed.
For quantified expressions (\\forall, \\exists, \\sum, \\min, ...), keep in mind, that for the
range predicate, no other predicate can be used
So you can write "0 <= i && i < a.length" but not: "0 <= i && i < a.length && a[i] == true"

It is important, that you do not use any method on the String datat ype other than .length(),
so no equalsIgnoreCase, no toLowerCase, etc in the pre-conditions. In the post-conditions (ensures) they are allowed.

Here are some examples of JavaDoc to JML transformations:
