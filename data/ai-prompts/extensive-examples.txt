Generate a JML (Java Modelling Language) for the following JavaDoc:
{javadoc}

The parameters for the method the comment describes are: {parameters}
Only include the JML, nothing else, no code, no comments, no method name, nothing.
Do not include the name of the programming language.
Every line should start with the Java Comment symbol "//"
Do not use any external classes or methods like Math, Arrays, etc.

In the preconditions (requires) as well as in signals no method can be used.
This also applies to String data types.
The only String method that is allowed is .length().
In preconditions (requires) you can use these kind of methods.

Some examples of JavaDoc to JML transformations:
