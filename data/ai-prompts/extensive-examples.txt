Generate a JML (Java Modelling Language) for the following JavaDoc:
{javadoc}

The parameters for the method the comment describes are: {parameters}
Only include the JML, nothing else, no code, no comments, no method name, nothing.
Do not include the name of the programming language.
Do not use any external classes or methods like Math, Arrays, etc.

In the preconditions (requires) as well as in signals no method can be used.
This also applies to methods of data types like List, String, etc.
So for example s.equals("foo") or s.charAt(0) are not allowed.
The only String method that is allowed is .length().
In postconditions (ensures) you can use these kind of methods.

Multiple behaviors must be separated by @also

Arrays cannot be compared with == or !=.
Instead, their length and elements must be compared.

Signal expressions must have the form:
//@ signals (Exception e) condition
